## Richel's review

In this song, K3 describes losing a boyfriend, due to having hurt him,
and wanting him back. The song has two moods: forceful verses and a
cheerful chorus. The phrase 'I love you' is sung in four languages
(English, French, German, Spanish).

Personally, I enjoy the forceful lyrics, especially to write a letter to
all children in the whole of Europe. I am very curious how K3 hurt the
boyfriend: for me it sounds atypical that K3 hurts anyone, so where did
this originate from?
