In this song, K3 describes calling a boyfriend, but get connected to his
voice receiver, at which they tell their love to instead. In the end of
the song they have to disconnect, because there is somebody ringing at
the door, which is found out the boyfriend! The song has two moods:
cheerful verses, cheerful chorus and a full-of-happiness final verse.

 

Personally, I like this song a lot: I enjoy the idea of cheerfully
talking to a voice receiver as the best-left solution, as well as the
unexpected ending.
