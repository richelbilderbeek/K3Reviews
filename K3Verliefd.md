([K3](K3.htm)) [Verliefd](K3Verliefd.htm)
=========================================

 

[Verliefd](K3Verliefd.htm) is a [K3](K3.htm) song.

 

Category: love

Rating: 9/10

Favorite lyric: none

 

In this song, K3 describes the feeling of being in love. The song has
two moods: cheerful verses and an intense chorus. This song is one of
the few featuring a violin, which is strummed at the verses and played
at the chorus.

 

Personally, this one of my favorite songs: the melody and lyrics match
well and I experience the lyrics as elegant and light, introvert in the
verses and extravert in the chorus, and I enjoy this contrast.
