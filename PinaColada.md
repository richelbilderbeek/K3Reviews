Pina Colada
Pina Colada

Bazoeka [1]

Wat een zomer
de verf loopt van de muren [2]
het kwik is overstuur en [3]
ik voel de kriebels in mijn buik

wat een zomer 
het lijkt wel 40 graden
ik dans doorheen de straten [4]
een nieuwe vlinder die ontluikt [5]

en de pina colada staat koud [6]
maar vannacht wil ik enkel maar jou

[CHORUS]
Pina Colada, lambada, que nada [7]
Want ik wil enkel jou
Pina Colada, lambada, que ada
Want ik wil enkel jou

Wat een zomer
de ijsblokjes die knarsen
je strand[something] staat op barsten [8]
ik voel de kriebels in mijn buik

Wat een zomer
Je drankjes en oase
mijn lippen in extase
een nieuwe vlinder die ontluikt

en de Pina colada staat koud
maar vannacht wil ik enkel maar jou

[CHORUS]

[CHORUS]

[CHORUS]

## Richel's review

In this song, K3 sings about being in love in summer.

This song has nothing to do with the drink pina colada. The song informs 
us that there is some pina colada in the refrigerator [6], after
which its role in completely ignored. This makes the listeren hypothesize
about the role. 

My favorite hypothesis is that the song describes the moment the girl meets the boy
on a date with the boy to drink pina colada with him. Instead of talking with
him first, she is already so excited and in love, that she wants to skip that
part of the date.

My second hypothesis changes the theme of the song altogether: that this
song is about loneliness. Originally, the girl bought a bottle of booze
for herself, to drink away this loneliness. The song then describes the
moment that she finds out that she misses him so much, that she cannot drink 
the pina colada anymore, and can only think about the boy. 

The third hypothesis is that the song actually has little meaning
and there is no connection between the boy and the pina colada. 
There are more K3 songs that have this, of which [Ushuaia](Ushuaia.md)
is a prime example ([Jongen Van Mijn Dromen](JongenVanMijnDromen.md) is a minor one),
where I think the only connection between different parts of the song is that the words
rhyme nicely. The writers of the lyrics also discovered that rhymes just as cheaply with
'lambada' and 'que nada'!

The happy tune of the song fits the first and third hypotheses best. 

The first verse is the apex of the song: I think that 'de verf loopt van de muren, het kwik is 
overstuur' [2,3] (English: 'the paint melts of the walls, the murcury (of a thermometer) is upset')
are fun metaphors. This is unlike 'een nieuwe vlinder die ontluikt' [5] (English: 'a new
butterfly that awakens'), which is a main cliche in my opinion.

I enjoy the vividness of `ik dans doorheen de straten` [4], although
it is clearly a re-use of `Ik liep doorheen de straten` in [VivaViool](VivaViool.md),
where it occurred first. 

I look forward to the day I find out what is bursting ('je strand[something] staat op barsten') [8].

I think the song has a high density of choruses, with just two verses. This is typical for the 
K3 party songs, like for example [Aliyee](Aliyee.md), [Oya Lele](OyaLele.md), [Loko Le](LokoLe.md) or [MaMaSe](MaMaSe.md).
Note how those former party songs all have [nonsensical titles](NonsensicalTitles.md), where
this song has a reasonable title.

The intro is full of [jabbertalk](Jabbertalk.md), which I don't like. I think [jabbertalk](Jabbertalk.md) is just stupid.
Would they do this to attract younger children, and assuming kids think it is funny? What I do think is funny:
at 0:08 (8 seconds) the word 'Bazoeka' [1] (English: bazooka, a type of gun) is spoken.

In conclusion: this is just a dime-a-dozen happy song, with little content. I hope K3 tries harder to
create more meaningful songs unlike this one. Examples are [Doe Maar](DoeMaar.md),
[Prinsesje En Superman](PrinsesjeEnSuperman.md), [Je Hebt Een Vriend](JeHebtEenVriend.md), the
widely underestimated [Meisjesdag](Meisjesdag.md) and the classic [Verliefd](Verliefd.md).
