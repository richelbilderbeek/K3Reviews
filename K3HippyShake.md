([K3](K3.htm)) [Hippy Shake](K3HippyShake.htm)
==============================================

 

[Hippy Shake](K3HippyShake.htm) is a [K3](K3.htm) song.

 

Category: party

Rating: 7/10

Favorite lyric: 'Die house beat, heeft afgedaan'

 

In this song, K3 longs forward to go dancing a dance called the 'Hippy
Shake' on Saterday. The song has two moods: neutral verses and an
energetic chorus. The verses appear to use a a subset of the melodies of
the chorus and sounds very similar.

 

Personally, I like the song better than I can rationalize: the song is
about a dance I don't know (I can scarcely remember having seen the
video clip for some seconds) and partying in the weekend, my least
favorite K3 theme. Yet, the melody appeals to me in some unknown way and
the lyrics are somewhere in a sweet spot between mindless fun and
classy-and-appearing-to-be-a-parody.
