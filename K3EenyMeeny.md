([K3](K3.htm)) [Eeny Meeny](K3Eeny%20Meeny.htm)
===============================================

 

[Eeny Meeny](K3Eeny%20Meeny.htm) is a [K3](K3.htm) song.

 

Category: love

Rating: 4/10

Favorite lyric: 'Ik hou van Bert, maar ik houd ook van Jan'

 

In this song, K3 sing about being in love with two men, and unable to
choose, they choose one at random. The song has two moods: neutral
verses and a cheerful chorus.

 

Personally, I dislike the lyrics for pursueing monogamy (as the girls
have to choose), instead of considering a more liberal relationship. I
think my favorite lyric should have been 'Ik love Gert, but I also love
Sam(son)'.
