## Richel's review

In this song, K3 sing about falling in love and asking him for help. The
song has two moods: neutral verses and a neutral chorus.

Personally, I think this is a dull and plain song. There is one line in
the lyrics that deserves special attention: 'Toe zeg me dat jij ook af
en toe eens zwicht voor trouble op het eerste gezicht: in my opinion (1)
a Dutch synonym for 'trouble' could and should have been used (2)
assuming that the word 'trouble' is used for the correct metrum: the
metrum still does not work.
