## Load all reviews

```{r}
df <- get_songs_ratings(get_all_song_filenames())
knitr::kable(head(df))
```

## Count songs and reviews

```{r}
filenames <- unique(df$filename)

message("Reviewed: ", n_reviewed)
message("Not reviewed: ", n_unreviewed)
```

## How many reviews have been done?

```{r}
ggplot(na.omit(df), aes(x = formation, fill = reviewer)) +
  geom_histogram(stat = "count")
```


## What are the grades given by the reviewers?

```{r}
df$rating <- as.numeric(df$rating)
ggplot(na.omit(df), aes(x = reviewer, y = rating)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

## What are the grades given by the reviewers?

```{r}
