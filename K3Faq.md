# FAQ

## Why are the reviews in English?

Because English is the lingua franca spoken by academia.

## Who are you?

I am an adult male working at a university as a researcher. See [my website](http://www.richelbilderbeek.nl) for more details.

## What is your goal of these reviews?

I think it shows my thorough knowledge of the ouvre of K3 and I hope Studio 100 (the producers of K3) will ask me for advice when choosing new songs.

## Do you consider yourself a fan?

Judge for yourself:
 * I do buy the CDs that had at least one unique song on them, when the price drops to ten euros
 * I do not buy collection CDs, as these contain no new songs
 * I do visit their concert once a year at a seat in the far back, as I think the kids should be in the front
 * I do listen to their music on a regular basis
 * I do not like all their songs
 * I do not watch the YouTube clips
 * I do not follow their TV series and TV shows
 * I do not have much merchandize, only a bread box (for electronic parts), refrigerator magnets and a pink microphone
 * I do not have posters hanging in my room
 * I have not painted the walls of my room pink
 * I have read the autobiography of Kathleen

## Who is your favorite girl?

I can rank them:
 * (1) Karen
 * (2) Josje
 * (3) Kristel
 * (4) Kathleen

I like Karen best, because she is most tomboyish, has a bit of a whiskey voice and has the naughtiest eyes. I like Josje because of her high speed and pretty Dutch accent. Kristel has the sweetest and most sincere smile. I started to appreciate Kathleen only after reading the autobiography she wrote when she left the group.
