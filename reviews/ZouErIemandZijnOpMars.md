## Richel's review

In this song, K3 describes feeling lonely, hoping for somebody that will
love them. The song is one of the few English Waltzes of their
repetoire. There are some French backing vocals and some Flemish lines
spoken by K3 in between the verses. The song has two moods: the
neutral-sensitive verses and a neutral chorus.

Personally, I really like the melody and the lyrics. I think the lyrics
are not brilliant, but they fit the melody well, and I like the naming
of planets as well as the French backing vocals that fit the atmosphere
of the song well.
