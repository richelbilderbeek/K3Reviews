# Sterren

 * Category: love
 * Rating: 7/10
 * Favorite lyric: none

In this song, K3 describes having fun activities with a boyfriend and
the sensation of kissing him. The song has a neutral verse, a cheerful
chorus and a more sensitive verse in which K3 phantasizes about
marriage.

Personally, I enjoy this song as I like the cheerful activities of K3
and the boy, as well as the romance of them kissing. Mentioning
celestial objects is also a plus for me.
