# Blond

## Richel's idea about the topic 'Blond'

Some K3 songs describe blond being the most attractive hair color.

Using `egrep -r "blond` one can see this happens in the songs
 * Dokter Dokter, where the boy is blond
 * Filmster, where being blond is a noteworthy aspect of being beautiful
 * Ik Wil Bamba, where being blond is a noteworthy aspect of being beautiful
 * Loko Le, where it is suggested that the listener would prefer to be blond

I do not understand why being blond is an important aspect of beauty, as all K3 girls are equally beautiful. 

My hypothesis is that it is used just for the rhyme. As I do think this is not fair to the other
girls, I suggest either to not use the word 'blond' for the rhyming, or use the other hair
colors equally for the rhyming as well.
