In this song, K3 states everybody should be tolerant for skin color,
that it is sad when people are discriminated, and that K3 will give a
good example. In the chorus there are non-Dutch non-English non-French
non-German backing vocals, his first word being 'Africa!'. The song has
three moods: happy (the chorus), neutral (most verses) and sensitive
(the verse about not being accepted).

 

Personally, I think the lyrics are uninspired, without wit nor jokes nor
naughtiness. The backing vocals are in my humble opinion more of an
irrelevancy and annoyance, than a contribution.
