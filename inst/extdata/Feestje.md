## Richel's review

In this song, K3 sing about organizing a party. The song has two moods:
neutral verses and a neutral chorus.

Personally, I like lyrics to actually describe something more than just
partying. My favorite lyric ("To the landfill with the comfortable chair
and set the bed on fire, because we will never sleep again") is the only
reason for me to listen to this song: I enjoy these forceful statements!
