## Richel's review

This song is about a caterpillar sing about himself being a butterfly, where K3 tries to convince him he is a caterpillar.

I know this song is part of the musical 'K3 In Wonderland' and I can imagine the situation the girls are in.
The caterpillar is the main singer is this song. I do think the singer plays his role very well, but I prefer
listening to the sweet K3 voices. So, everytime K3 starts singing, this feels as a refreshment. But that does
not fix the rest of the song.
