## Richel's review

In this song, K3 has critique on politicians (especially on the ministry
of defense and a general). Then they describe how they want to be queen
of a fictional country called 'Lollipopland', where they would solve all
problems by giving the people complaining a lollipop. The song has an
up-tempo-except-for-the-bass verse and a cheerful chorus type

Personally, I think the lyrics describe two unrelated topics: the
mishaps in current politics and the dream of being a queen in a fantasy
world. This is exactly my point of critique: I wish the lyrics were
about either (1) criticizing current politics and present a real-world
or at least witty solution, or (2) being the queen in a fantasy world
and doing fun/witty/naught things in this position. In my opinion, the
song is simply a complaint and a boring dream next to each other.
