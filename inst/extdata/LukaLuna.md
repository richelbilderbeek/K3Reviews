## Richel's review

In this song, K3 sings about a child love.

I dislike the jabbertalk-like name 'Luka Luna' and I see no point
why the name of that boy is important.

In the end, the clue is that she fell in love with Luka Luna at the age of 4.
I don't see the fun nor usefulness of that plot twist.
