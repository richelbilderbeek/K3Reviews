## Richel's review

In this song, K3 sings about a guy they enjoy.

The intro of the song is beautiful and romantic, after which
the song degrades to regular K3 party song. Due to this, my rating
for this song is the mean of how I appreciate the romantic part (8 out of 10)
and the party part (4 out of 10).
